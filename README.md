## 1. Abstract & Objective

This project aims to design and implement a high-performance, energy-efficient hardware accelerator for Transformer-based neural networks. The primary goal is to address the significant computational bottlenecks in modern AI applications by exploring novel architectural optimizations to **minimize latency** and **maximize throughput**. This research is motivated by the critical need for efficient hardware in both large-scale data centers and resource-constrained edge devices, a challenge that is particularly pronounced in the world of high-frequency trading where every nanosecond counts.

## 2. Background & Motivation

The Transformer architecture, first introduced in the seminal paper **"Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017)**, has become the foundational model for a vast range of AI tasks. However, its computational complexity, particularly in the multi-head self-attention mechanism, presents a significant challenge for real-time inference on conventional hardware.

This research is inspired by state-of-the-art industry solutions, such as the work presented by NVIDIA researchers in **"A 95.6-TOPS/W Deep Learning Inference Accelerator With Per-Vector Scaled 4-bit Quantization in 5 nm" (Keller et al., 2023)**. This paper demonstrates the potential for massive efficiency gains through hardware/software co-design and advanced quantization techniques. My goal is to explore these principles to build a highly optimized system.

## 3. Planned Architecture & Methodology

The accelerator will be designed using a hardware-first methodology, focusing on the following key areas:

* **Architectural Design:** Explore and evaluate different dataflow architectures (e.g., output stationary, weight stationary) to optimize on-chip data reuse and minimize costly off-chip memory access, which are critical for latency-sensitive applications.

* **RTL Implementation:** The entire design will be implemented in **Verilog/SystemVerilog**, focusing on creating a synthesizable, high-frequency, and modular design suitable for both FPGA prototyping and potential ASIC implementation.

* **Verification:** A robust testbench will be developed in **C++** (potentially using frameworks like Verilator or Cocotb) to ensure functional correctness and to perform rigorous performance verification against a software model.

* **Key Optimization Focus:**
    * Design of a highly parallelized Processing Element (PE) array for large-scale matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations.
    * Architectural support for low-precision data formats (e.g., INT4/INT8) and advanced quantization techniques like Per-Vector Scaled Quantization (VSQ) to improve efficiency, as inspired by the referenced NVIDIA paper.
    * Optimization of the memory subsystem and on-chip interconnects to handle the complex data access patterns of the attention mechanism.
